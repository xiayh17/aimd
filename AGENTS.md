# AGENTS

## Scope

- `packages/*` are publishable AIMD packages (`@airalogy/aimd-*`).

## Documentation Layout

- Package READMEs live in `packages/<package-name>/README.md` and `packages/<package-name>/README.zh-CN.md`.
- Docs site source lives in `docs/`.
- English package docs live in `docs/en/packages/<package-name>.md`.
- Chinese package docs live in `docs/zh/packages/<package-name>.md`.
- Docs site config lives in `docs/.vitepress/config.mjs`.

## Documentation Expectations For AI Agents

- When changing public package API, user-facing behavior, onboarding flow, or examples, update the relevant package README and matching docs pages under `docs/en/` and `docs/zh/`.
- Keep English and Chinese docs aligned in scope unless the user explicitly asks otherwise.
- Keep package README concise and onboarding-focused; put fuller explanations and API usage in `docs/`.

## Versioning Policy For AI Agents

- When a change affects a package's **published behavior**, update that package version in its `package.json`.
- When a publishable package version is bumped, update that package's `CHANGELOG.md` in the same change.
- Keep the changelog entry scoped to the package itself; do not describe unrelated workspace changes in another package's changelog.
- Use SemVer:
  - `major`: breaking API/behavior changes.
  - `minor`: backward-compatible feature additions.
  - `patch`: backward-compatible bug fixes.
- Treat these as version-worthy by default:
  - Public API/type export changes.
  - Runtime behavior changes users can observe.
  - Parser/renderer output changes.
  - Build output that downstream users consume.

## Changes That Usually Do Not Need Version Bump

- Internal refactor with no external behavior change.
- Tests only.
- Docs only.
- CI/tooling/config changes not affecting package runtime/API.

## Commit vs Version Bump

- Do **not** bump version on every commit.
- Bump versions when preparing a release (or when your workflow requires release metadata in each PR).
- If unsure whether a change is externally visible, prefer:
  - Ask for confirmation, or
  - Do at least a `patch` bump.
- If you do bump a package version, treat updating that package changelog as required release metadata, not optional follow-up work.
