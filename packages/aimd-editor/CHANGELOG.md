# Changelog

All notable changes to `@airalogy/aimd-editor` will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Fixed AIMD inline type highlighting so `UpperCamelCase` types (for example `UserName`, `CurrentTime`, `AiralogyMarkdown`) are consistently tokenized as `type.aimd` instead of being split into mixed colors.
- Replaced case-insensitive identifier matching with explicit `[A-Za-z_]` matching to avoid Monaco regex edge cases where leading uppercase letters were not tokenized correctly.
